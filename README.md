# MTG-Life-Total
Life total for EDH Commander MTG

A wise man once told me... "The problem with being a developer is everything you want to do, someone has done it and better"

This statement could not me more true once I saw that Antsy created the SAME APP AS ME BUT BETTER. I guess you can say great minds think alike. I actually used this app to to enjoy a game of Commander with some buddies. 

I just wanted to upload this for my own sanity. Antsy you are awesome!
